Previously I was a Research Associate at Robot Vision Group. I worked on the PAMELA project, with Prof. Andrew Davison and Prof. Paul Kelly. At Imperial College London, I work on many interesting and cutting-edge robotics and vision algorithms and devices including focal-plane sensor-processor arrays (FPSP), deep learning, and active vision.
